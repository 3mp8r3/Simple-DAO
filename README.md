# :cyclone: Simple DAO 

This Decentralized Applications (Dapp) is a simple Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that functionally mimics an Investment Manager. 
 
 ## 🗽 How this works

The smart contract is designed to be very simple (at this moment). The DAO smart contract will collect money in Eth from investors and allocate shares to them. The contract will keep track of contributions in # of shares. Investors are allowed to transfer shares, create proposals, as well as vote.
